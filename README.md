### Description

A fast paced first person game focused around movement and speed. The player is equipped with a "Propulsor", which pushes them backwards when fired. The game takes place over a variety of unique locations where they race to the exit as fast as they can, while looking for powerups or secrets to either speed them up or discover new hidden locations.

### Developing

Please use the official C# style guide where possible, but with tabs instead of spaces for indentation.
Node and Scene names should follow `PascalCase` rather than the Godot default of `snake_case` (this has been changed in project settings).

# Notes

Please don't edit any of the player's values it will break everything
